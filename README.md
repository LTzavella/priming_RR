# Data & analyses scripts 

This repository will contain the data collected for a pre-registered study and already includes R scripts for analyses: 

***Tzavella, L., Chambers, C., & Maizey, L. (2019, January 29). The affective priming paradigm as an implicit measure of food attitudes and related choice behaviour. Retrieved from <a href="osf.io/zqrby">osf.io/zqrby</a>*** 

All files should be downloaded as a zip folder.

The scripts should be run in a session open under ***'Food_priming.RProj'*** in RStudio.

The scripts are designed to be run ***in sequence***:

1. Pre-processing pipeline.Rmd
2. Pre-registered analyses.Rmd
3. Robustness checks.Rmd

The scripts process both laboratory and online data, which are then analysed separately.

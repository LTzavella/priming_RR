All files should be downloaded as a zip folder.

The scripts should be run in a session open under 'Food_priming.RProj'.

The scripts are designed to be run in sequence:

1. Pre-processing pipeline.Rmd
2. Pre-registered analyses.Rmd
3. Robustness checks.Rmd

The scripts process both laboratory and online data, which are then analysed separately.
